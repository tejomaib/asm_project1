The program is designed for the **STM32F01RE microcontroller**, which belongs to the STM32F0 series of ARM Cortex-M0-based microcontrollers. It utilizes **GPIOC** (General Purpose Input/Output Port C) to interface with external components. Specifically, **PC0** is configured as an input pin with a pull-up resistor to read the state of a switch or sensor, while **PC1, PC2, and PC3** are configured as output pins to control three LEDs. The program interacts with several key registers to manage these functionalities. The **RCC_AHBENR** register at address **0x40023830** is used to enable the clock for GPIOC by setting bit 2. The **GPIOC_MODER** register at address **0x40020800** configures the mode of the pins, setting PC1, PC2, and PC3 as output pins by writing `01` to their respective mode bits. The **GPIOC_PUPDR** register at address **0x4002080C** is used to configure the pull-up resistor for PC0. The **GPIOC_IDR** register at address **0x40020810** reads the input state of PC0, and the **GPIOC_ODR** register at address **0x40020814** controls the output state of PC1, PC2, and PC3 to turn the LEDs on or off. This program demonstrates how to use assembly language to interact with the STM32F01RE's GPIO registers, making it suitable for basic embedded applications such as controlling LEDs based on switch or sensor input.
